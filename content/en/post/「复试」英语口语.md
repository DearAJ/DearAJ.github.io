Good morning, professors. My name is Yang Aijun. I am from Beihang University, where I majored in Computer Science and Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I built a strong foundation in mathematics and programming, and I try to keep up with the latest developments in computer science by reviewing journal papers. I actively participated in various competitions, and earned awards for my efforts. And my graduation thesis was recognized as one of the most outstanding project at the school level.

Additionally, I have gained practical experience through internships at China Software and Technology Company, Beihang University, and Tsinghua University. During these experiences, I worked on AI-related projects such as world models, time series prediction, reinforcement learning, and object detection. These experiences have greatly enhanced my skills and deepened my passion for computer science.

As for my master studies, I plan to focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of artificial intelligence, particularly reinforcement learning. My goal is to become an outstanding engineer and contribute meaningfully to this industry. I strongly believe that the progress made in these fields will drive significant changes in technology.

That's all for my brief introdution. Thank you very much for taking the time to interview me.

- #### **Research and Implementation of Psychological Crisis Prediction (Graduation Project)**

  For my graduation project, I worked on a system that **predicts psychological crisis** in school students. The idea was to create a tool that could **identify students who might be at risk early**, so mental health professionals could help them before things get worse.

  I built a prediction model using **Attention-LSTM**. I added an “attention” feature to make the model **focus on the most important parts of the data.** This made the model more **accurate and easier to understand.** The model worked really well, which was much better than  traditional ones, such as DNN and GRU.

  I also made another model using **LightGBM** to check how serious the risks were. LightGBM is a fast machine learning tool that works well with large data. This model not only predicted if a student was at risk, but also told us **how serious the risk was**. This helped mental health professionals know who needed more urgent help.

  In the end, we put these models into **an online platform**, so students could easily check their own mental health and ask for help if needed. The platform also protected students' privacy.

  Another important feature was that the system looked at groups of students, not just one student. In this way, schools could see common problems and take action as a group. This made things faster and helped reduce the workload for the mental health staff.

&nbsp;

+ **介绍用的模型**

  LSTM models are good at processing sequential data, and the attention mechanism helps the model focus on the critical parts of the input sequence, improving prediction results.

  I chose LightGBM because it is very fast and works well with large data. It uses a method called gradient boosting, which helps make accurate predictions. LightGBM can also handle missing data and categories, making it a good choice for my project.

+ **为什么想做论文这个研究**

  I want to do this research because I’ve noticed that **many students with mental health problems don’t get help in time**, which can lead to serious problems. As AI is one of the latest technologies, I believe it should be used to serve humanity. After analyzing many related data and research, I decided to focus on **helping students’ mental health from a group point of view**.

- **相关知识**

  - **介绍神经网络**

    A neural network is a type of computer system inspired by how the human brain works. It is made up of layers of connected neurons. These neurons work together to solve problems.

  - **如何减少神经网络的误差？**

    1. We can use **more** and **better data** for training.
    2. **Regularization methods like dropout** can prevent the network from overfitting.
    3. Lastly, adjusting the **learning rate can** help the network learn more effectively.

  - **什么是反向传播**

    Backpropagation is a method used to **train neural networks**. The network does this by **calculating the error**, and then **sending this error backward** through the network to **update the weights**.

  - **过拟合**

    Overfitting happens when the network **learns too much from the training data** and does **not generalize well to new data**. You can prevent it by using techniques like **regularization** and **dropout**.

  - **激活函数**

    **Activation functions** help decide whether a **neuron** should be **activated** or not. Examples include ReLU and Sigmoid.

  - **梯度下降**

    Gradient descent is used to **minimize the error** by **updating the weights** in the network.

  - **epochs and batches**

    An epoch is **one complete pass** through the training data

    a batch is **a set of the data** used to **update the weights** during training

  - **the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning**

    Supervised learning uses **labeled data** to train the model,

    while unsupervised learning uses **unlabeled data** and **finds patterns without needing labels**.

- #### China Software and Technology Company

  During my internship at Zhicheng Technology, I had the chance to work on improving a platform to make **risk monitoring** better. The goal was to make sure any problems with operational vehicles/ˈvɪə.kəls/ were dealt with properly.

  In this project, we had to check about 80 million driving records to find issues like taxi drivers not using the meter  /ˈmiː.tər/ or picking up extra passengers. My job was to help find these problems using data analysis and computer vision.

  One of the biggest challenges I faced was that **the tracking would stop too early** if the objects were **blocked** or not **detected well.** To fix this, I worked with experts to improve the system. I trained a **CNN-based model** to better detect features, which made the system more reliable.

  I started by using a **large dataset of images** to teach the model how to identify important features, like shapes and movements.

  I worked on tuning the model's **hyperparameters**, like the **learning rate** and the number of **layers**, to make it more accurate. I also adjusted the **batch size** and the number of **epochs** to ensure the model was training well and not overfitting.

  Through this process, I was able to improve the model’s ability to detect features more reliably, which made the system better at identifying issues in the data.

- **Principle**: YOLO and Deep SORT were used for object detection and tracking in video data to monitor taxi violations. The Mahalanobis Distance replaced the default association metric to improve tracking robustness under occlusion.

- **Why it works**: YOLO detects objects quickly and accurately, while Deep SORT tracks them over time. Mahalanobis Distance accounts for the relationship between object features, making tracking more reliable.







+ ### Tinghua

  I explored innovative applications and advancements of World Models in embodied intelligence, focusing on core technologies such as generative AI and reinforcement learning.

  Through literature review, I analyzed multimodal perception frameworks and dynamic decision-making mechanisms, studied typical application scenarios, and authored a related survey paper.

  Using the PPO algorithm, I trained an autonomous driving agent in the CARLA simulation environment. I designed and implemented a multimodal input processing framework, extracting features via a dynamic network to generate shared representations. The value network predicted state values, while the policy network, modeled with a Beta distribution, controlled throttle, brake, and steering, improving control accuracy and stability.

  For the dynamic network, I used a CNN to extract image features and combined road, vehicle, and navigation data as inputs to a GRU for temporal modeling. A linear combination method fused multimodal features, enhancing the agent’s perception and decision-making in complex environments.
